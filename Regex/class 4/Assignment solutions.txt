ASSIGNMENT :-

Q1 user input on number of unit in integer
- for the starting 10 unit price is 50 rs each
- for the next 20 unit price is 20 rs each
- for the rest of unit price will be 10rs
calculate the total price
100  =>  500  +400 +700
90
70
Solution :-
num_units = int(input("Enter number of units: "))

total_price = 0

if num_units <= 10:
    total_price = num_units * 50  
elif num_units <= 30:
    total_price = 10 * 50 + (num_units - 10) * 20  
else:
    total_price = 10 * 50 + 20 * 20 + (num_units - 30) * 10  

print("Total price:", total_price)


Q2:
take 3 number as input from a user as 3 side of a triangle
and check whether it will create a triagle or not
Solution:-
side1 = float(input("Enter length of side 1: "))
side2 = float(input("Enter length of side 2: "))
side3 = float(input("Enter length of side 3: "))

if side1 + side2 > side3 and side2 + side3 > side1 and side1 + side3 > side2:
    print("Yes, these sides can form a triangle.")
else:
    print("No, these sides cannot form a triangle.")


Q3 Take two number from the user and check whether both the number are divisble
by 6
( divisibility rule say it should be divided by 2 and 3)
Solution :-
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

if num1 % 6 == 0 and num2 % 6 == 0:
    print("Both numbers are divisible by 6.")
else:
    if num1 % 6 == 0:
        print(f"The first number ({num1}) is divisible by 6.")
    else:
        print(f"The first number ({num1}) is not divisible by 6.")

    if num2 % 6 == 0:
        print(f"The second number ({num2}) is divisible by 6.")
    else:
        print(f"The second number ({num2}) is not divisible by 6.")
